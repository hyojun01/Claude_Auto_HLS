# Vitis HLS IP Design & Verification Environment

An automated environment for FPGA IP design, verification, and optimization using **AMD Vitis HLS**, orchestrated by **Claude Code**.

## Quick Start

### 1. Design a New IP

Create a folder for your IP and add the specification:

```bash
mkdir -p src/my_filter/
cp src/.template/instruction.md src/my_filter/instruction.md
```

Edit `src/my_filter/instruction.md` with your IP's requirements (I/O ports, data types, algorithm, target FPGA, etc.), then run:

```
/design-ip my_filter
```

Claude Code will design the IP, write testbenches, run simulation and synthesis, and generate documentation automatically.

### 2. Optimize an Existing IP

Add an optimization instruction document:

```bash
cp src/.template/optimization.md src/my_filter/optimization.md
```

Edit `src/my_filter/optimization.md` with your performance targets, then run:

```
/optimize-ip my_filter
```

Claude Code will apply HLS optimizations, re-verify correctness, and update documentation.

## Agents

| Agent | Role | Responsibility |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **Main Agent** | Senior FPGA/HLS Lead | Plans, orchestrates, validates, triggers upgrades |
| **Design Agent** | HLS Design Engineer | Implements IP in C++ |
| **Synth-Sim Agent** | HLS Verification Engineer | Testbenches, C-sim, synthesis |
| **Optimization Agent** | HLS Optimization Engineer | Pragmas, code restructuring |
| **Docs Agent** | Documentation Engineer | IP documentation, changelogs |
| **Upgrade Agent** | Environment Improvement Engineer | Proposes environment config upgrades |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/design-ip <name>` | Full IP design pipeline (design → sim → synth → docs) |
| `/optimize-ip <name>` | Optimization pipeline (optimize → re-verify → update docs) |

## Instruction Document Format

### `instruction.md` (Required for `/design-ip`)

Must include: functional description, I/O port table, data types, algorithm description, target FPGA part and clock period, and test scenarios.

### `optimization.md` (Required for `/optimize-ip`)

Must include: optimization goals (latency/throughput/resources) with priorities, acceptable trade-offs, and constraints.

See `src/.template/` for complete templates.

## Prerequisites

- **AMD Vitis HLS** 2023.1 or later
- Source the Vitis HLS environment: `source /path/to/Vitis_HLS/settings64.sh`
- Claude Code CLI

## Running TCL Scripts Manually

If Vitis HLS is not in the automated environment, run scripts manually:

```bash
cd src/<ip_name>
vitis_hls -f tcl/run_csim.tcl      # C-simulation
vitis_hls -f tcl/run_csynth.tcl    # C-synthesis
vitis_hls -f tcl/run_cosim.tcl     # Co-simulation
```
