├── YES → Unroll loops (full or partial)
│         ├── Resources OK? → Done
│         └── Too many resources? → Partial unroll (factor=N)

## Common Bottleneck Patterns and Fixes

### 1. II Violation Due to Memory Conflict
**Symptom**: Synthesis reports II > 1 with "unable to schedule load/store on memory port"
**Root Cause**: Two or more array accesses in the same cycle competing for one memory port
**Fix**:
```cpp
int arr[256];
#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=arr type=cyclic factor=2
// Now arr has 2 ports, supporting 2 accesses per cycle
```

### 2. II Violation Due to Loop-Carried Dependency
**Symptom**: II > 1 with "dependency" warning
**Root Cause**: Iteration N depends on result of iteration N-1
**Fix options**:
- Code restructuring to break dependency chain
- Accumulator tree for reductions
- `#pragma HLS DEPENDENCE variable=arr inter false` (only if no true dependency)

### 3. High Latency from Sequential Stages
**Symptom**: Total latency = sum of all stage latencies
**Root Cause**: Stages execute sequentially
**Fix**:
```cpp
#pragma HLS DATAFLOW
read_stage(in, pipe1);
process_stage(pipe1, pipe2);
write_stage(pipe2, out);
// Now stages overlap → total latency ≈ max(stage latencies)
```

### 4. Excessive Resource Usage from Full Unroll
**Symptom**: LUT/DSP usage exceeds target
**Fix**: Use partial unroll
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 1024; i++) {
    #pragma HLS UNROLL factor=4  // Instead of full unroll
    #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
    // 4x parallelism instead of 1024x
}
```

### 5. Poor Burst Efficiency on AXI Master
**Symptom**: Low throughput on DDR access
**Fix**:
```cpp
#pragma HLS INTERFACE m_axi port=mem bundle=gmem \
    max_read_burst_length=256 num_read_outstanding=16
// Use sequential access pattern in a pipelined loop
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
    local[i] = mem[i];  // Sequential → generates burst
}
```

### 6. Excessive DSP Usage from Wide Casts in MAC Loops
**Symptom**: DSP count is 2-4x higher than the number of logical multiplies
**Root Cause**: Explicit casts to a wide accumulator type before multiplication force HLS to generate wide multiplies (e.g., 45×45) that require multiple DSP48 slices each. DSP48E1 natively supports 25×18; anything wider chains multiple slices.
**Fix**: Let HLS multiply at natural operand width, then promote the result during accumulation:
```cpp
// BAD: casts widen operands before multiply → multiple DSPs per multiply
acc += (acc_t)coeff * (acc_t)(a + b);

// GOOD: natural-width multiply → 1 DSP each, result promoted on accumulate
acc += coeff * (a + b);
```
**Evidence**: `fir` IP — 23 multiplies at natural width (16×17) = 23 DSPs; same multiplies cast to acc_t (45-bit) = 76 DSPs. Pipeline depth also dropped from 19 to 9 cycles.

### 7. Excessive BRAM from DATAFLOW PIPO Buffers
**Symptom**: BRAM usage exceeds budget in a DATAFLOW design; synthesis report shows PIPO (ping-pong) buffers consuming most BRAM
**Root Cause**: Vitis HLS implements DATAFLOW inter-task buffers as BRAM-based ping-pong memories by default. Each array passed between DATAFLOW stages becomes a PIPO buffer using 1+ BRAM blocks.
**Fix**: Convert PIPO buffers to distributed RAM (LUTRAM) using BIND_STORAGE. Add the pragma immediately after each buffer declaration inside the DATAFLOW top function:
```cpp
// In the DATAFLOW top function, after each inter-stage buffer declaration:
data_t buf_stage1[N];
#pragma HLS BIND_STORAGE variable=buf_stage1 type=ram_s2p impl=lutram

data_t buf_stage2[N];
#pragma HLS BIND_STORAGE variable=buf_stage2 type=ram_s2p impl=lutram
```
**Trade-off**: LUTRAM uses LUT/FF resources instead of BRAM. Verify LUT budget after conversion. This technique is favorable when BRAM savings are large (>50%) and post-conversion LUT usage stays below ~60% of the target device.
**Evidence**: `fft` IP — 18 PIPO buffers converted from BRAM to LUTRAM. BRAM: 107 → 15 (86% reduction). LUT: 5,517 → 18,437 (34.7%, within budget on xc7z020).

### 8. DSP Chaining from Operands Exceeding DSP48 Native Width
**Symptom**: DSP count is 2-4x higher than the number of logical multiplies, even without wide casts (see pattern #6)
**Root Cause**: The accumulator or operand type is wider than the DSP slice's native multiplier. On 7-series / Zynq-7000 (DSP48E1), the native multiplier is **25×18 bits** (signed). When operand A exceeds 25 bits or operand B exceeds 18 bits, HLS splits the multiply across multiple DSP slices.
**Fix**: Size operand types so that `A ≤ 25 bits` and `B ≤ 18 bits` (including the sign bit for signed types):
```cpp
// BAD: 45-bit accumulator used as multiply operand → chained DSPs
typedef ap_fixed<45, 15> acc_t;   // 45 bits > 25 → multi-DSP
typedef ap_fixed<16, 1>  tw_t;    // 16 bits ≤ 18 ✓
acc_t result = acc * tw;          // 45 × 16 → 2+ DSPs per multiply

// GOOD: narrow accumulator fits DSP48E1 A-port
typedef ap_fixed<25, 10> acc_t;   // 25 bits ≤ 25 ✓
typedef ap_fixed<16, 1>  tw_t;    // 16 bits ≤ 18 ✓
acc_t result = acc * tw;          // 25 × 16 → exactly 1 DSP per multiply
```
**Design rule**: When choosing operand widths, consult the target device's DSP native multiplier size:
  - **7-series / Zynq-7000 (DSP48E1)**: 25 × 18 (signed)
  - **UltraScale / UltraScale+ (DSP48E2)**: 27 × 18 (signed)
  - **Versal (DSP58)**: 27 × 24 (signed)
**Note**: This pattern differs from pattern #6 (wide casts). Pattern #6 addresses unnecessary widening *before* multiplication via explicit casts. This pattern addresses fundamental operand *type definitions* being too wide for the target DSP architecture.
**Evidence**: `fft` IP — accumulator narrowed from `ap_fixed<45,15>` (45 bits) to `ap_fixed<25,10>` (25 bits), twiddle factor kept at `ap_fixed<16,1>` (16 bits). DSP: 80 → 30 (63% reduction). Each butterfly multiply uses exactly 1 DSP48E1.

## Optimization Recipes by IP Type

### Signal Processing (FIR, FFT, Convolution)
1. `ARRAY_PARTITION complete` on coefficient arrays
2. `UNROLL` on multiply-accumulate loops
3. `PIPELINE II=1` on sample processing loop
4. Use `ap_fixed` to minimize DSP usage

### Image Processing (Filter, Resize, Color Convert)
1. Line buffer pattern with `ARRAY_PARTITION`
2. `PIPELINE II=1` on pixel processing loop
3. `DATAFLOW` between read → process → write stages
4. AXI-Stream interface for streaming pixels

### Data Movement (DMA, Scatter-Gather)
1. Wide data bus (`ap_uint<512>`)
2. Maximum burst length on AXI Master
3. Separate read and write bundles
4. `DATAFLOW` between read and write paths

### Control-Dominated (Protocol Handler, FSM)
1. `PIPELINE II=1` on the FSM loop
2. Minimal unrolling (logic, not data-parallel)
3. `INLINE` on state handler functions
4. Compact data types to minimize register usage
